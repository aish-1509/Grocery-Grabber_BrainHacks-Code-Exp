Project Description
-------------------

We've all faced the issue of expiring ingredients in our kitchens. For those who aren't skilled chefs, the choices are either improvising a dish or feeling guilty about food waste, which significantly contributes to environmental problems like climate change.

Food waste starts well before it reaches our homes, often beginning in the supermarket supply chain. NTUC FairPrice, Singapore’s largest supermarket chain, reported wasting 2,940 tonnes of food last year due to unsold items expiring. Despite offering discounts, supermarkets often fail to inform consumers effectively. Recognizing this gap, our team, Native Hackers—comprising Rudra Prasadh Ganesh, Esvaran Arun, Tejeswara Nehru, Karthik Adharsh and Kaliraj Santoshraj, decided to take action.

In the first week, we honed our wireframe, solidified our architecture, and crafted a compelling value proposition, which led us to the finals in CODE\_EXP, a mobile app development competition by DSTA, Singapore. In the lead-up to the competition, we dove deep into cutting-edge technologies. Meet GroceryGrabber, where we say “GG to climate change.”

Our app connects consumers with supermarkets, enabling users to see expiring products in nearby stores and create recipes using available ingredients. Key features include:

*   **Dynamic inventory management:** Users can add, edit, and delete ingredients while filtering by quantity and expiry date. To simplify inventory tracking, we used OpenAI’s GPT-4 for real-time receipt scanning.
    
*   **Map function:** Utilizes Google Maps to display nearby supermarkets and their expiring products.
    
*   **Search page:** Lists local supermarkets, their expiring items, and generates recipes using both the user’s ingredients and those available at the supermarket, complete with detailed instructions.
    

Our app offers even more functionality, but we invite users to discover it themselves. Although we didn’t win the competition, it was an enlightening experience that sparked a potential new interest for me in software development.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
    

Setup Instructions
------------------

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    *   ```git clone "https://github.com/Unknown-Blaze/BrainHacks-Code-Exp.git"```
        
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    *   ```cd NativeHackerApp```
        
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    
    *   ```npm install```
        
4.  **Check Expo Installation:**
    
    *   ```npm expo -v```
        
    *   Verify that a version number (e.g., 10.2.3) is displayed.
        
5.  **Download Expo Go:**
    
    *   Go to your app store and download the Expo Go app on your phone.
        
6.  **Create an Expo Account:**
    
    *   Sign up for an Expo account if you don’t already have one.
        
7.  **Start the Development Server:**
    
    *   ```npx expo start```
        
8.  **Scan the QR Code:**
    
    *   Use the Expo Go app on your phone to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.
        
9.  **Troubleshooting:**
    
    *   If anything doesn't work, check the Expo docs or ask ChatGPT.
        

Additional Notes
----------------

*   Ensure both your phone and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
    
*   Like React.js, real-time updates are enabled. Any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the app.
    
*   You can also run a web version or an emulator. Refer to the terminal output for available options.
